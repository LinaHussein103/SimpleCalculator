# SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS


Hello I am Lina, welcome to my dumb project that I created for practice

This is a basic calculator implemented using JavaScript. I created a simple interface using HTML and CSS for performing mathematical calculations

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations are supported (shocking, I know). Clear button to reset the calculator's state. Equal button to evaluate and display the result.

Keyboard input is enabled for convenient usage. Backspace to clear, enter for equal

To use, download all files into a folder, and open the index.html file in a web browser.

The code sets up event listeners for button clicks and keyboard inputs.
